# PatentAnalyzer
This is my first iOS app, about patent. 

So, what the goal?

This application - my university project (not me idea at all actually)

What will be in this app?
I get data from worlbank.org parse it and try to visualize all info.
Like in example with charts from Charts Pod https://cocoapods.org/pods/Charts

Stack of technology which will be here:
  
  First of all, MVVM arch.
  
  Some patterns like Observer
  
  RxSwift for async and MVVM
  
  Working with a network (with Alamofire maybe)
  
  Some Interface uniques libraries like Stork (already in app (ChartViewController))
  
  Working with JSON
  
  And try to follow SOLID rules.
  
Demo version were completed! Wathc gif.
