# PatentAnalyzer
This is my  iOS app, about patent. 

# Nowadays
demo version 1.1 

    - function for showing info by regions was added
    
    - some GCD updates
    
    - function for comparing countries - still in progress (few days left)
    
    - also left: changing API-working (response form server needed to be checking on errors), some interface updates, checking internet connection

# Overall

So, what the goal?

This application - my university project (not my idea at all, actually)

What will be in this app?
I get data from worlbank.org parse it and try to visualize all info.
Like in example with charts from Charts Pod https://cocoapods.org/pods/Charts
#
Stack of technology which will be here:
  
  First of all, MVVM arch.
  
  Some patterns like Observer
  
  RxSwift for async and MVVM (decided to don't use it)
  
  Working with a network (with Alamofire maybe)
  
  Some Interface uniques libraries like Stork (already in app (ChartViewController))
  
  Working with JSON
  
  And try to follow SOLID rules.
